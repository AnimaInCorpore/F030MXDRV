# DSP56001 implementation notes

The local `docs/DSP56001_um.pdf` is the architectural reference for the DSP
side. The current scaffold relies on these specific rules from the Motorola
DSP56000/DSP56001 User's Manual.

## Numeric representation

Section 4.2, “Data Representation and Rounding” (manual pages 4-9 onward),
defines data-ALU words as signed 24-bit fractional values with the binary point
left justified. The same bit patterns can be manipulated as small integers with
logical shifts and adds, as the current phase kernel does, but future use of
`MPY`/`MAC`, scaling mode, rounding, or accumulator limiting must account for
the fractional alignment explicitly. Generated ymfm lookup values are emitted
as raw 24-bit words rather than silently rescaled constants.

## Address-generation pipeline

Section 8.1, pipeline Case 2 (manual page 8-2), states that an indirect address
is formed before the preceding `MOVE` has finished writing its `Rn` register.
One independent instruction cycle is required between writing `Rn` and using
it for an indirect memory access. The same scheduling discipline is used for
the `Nn` offsets in `src/dsp/ym2151.asm`. Where there is no useful independent
instruction, the scaffold inserts a `NOP` before `x:(Rn+Nn)` or `y:(Rn+Nn)`.

## Hardware loops

The `DO` instruction description (manual pages A-63 through A-65) confirms that
the loop has no per-iteration overhead, but a count of zero means 65,536
iterations rather than zero. Variable-count loops in the phase kernel therefore
branch around `DO` when the count can be zero. Section 8.1.2 (manual pages 8-6
onward) also lists instructions forbidden near a loop end; loop bodies here are
kept to simple ALU or memory moves and are checked by Motorola ASM56000.

These constraints are part of correctness, not just optimization: violating
either the address delay or zero-count behavior produces valid assembly with
incorrect chip state at runtime.
